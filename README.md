# ListenList

ListenList is a pet project by [@idPro](http://twitter.com/idpro) that allows you to find Artists, Songs and Albums that you want to listen to, but can just never seen to find time. Using the [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) API, it helps you keep track of what you want to listen to and what you've already heard.

I've begun a [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/) version of the app that will, obviously, use Rdio as the source for searching and listening. It's still under active development, just need to get Listening working...
